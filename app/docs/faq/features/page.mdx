| Disallowing temporary / disposable email addresses from being used | ✅        |         | Uses the great [FakeFilter](https://fakefilter.net/static/docs/intro) project as a large, reliable list of temporary email address domains to filter out.                                                              |

| Restricting staff member logins to certain IP addresses            | ✅        |         | These are set via the "staff" settings. Be very careful as this may lock you out of the administrator panel.                                                                                                           |

| Network interface selection      | ✅        |         | It's up to individual modules to respect the specified setting. All FOSSBilling ones should do and if they don't it's then a bug, however we can't force a module built by a community member to use the correct interface & if one doesn't the developer needs to address it on their end. |
