## But wait... What is Docker?
Docker containers isolate the app from the host system and solve the "it works on my machine" headache. With this method, everyone using Docker runs virtually the same environment as the others. This is a great way to ensure that everyone has the same environment, thus making it less likely to have problems.

Docker also lets you run multiple containers on the same machine with different configurations. To learn more about containers, we strongly advise you to read Docker's [explanation](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) first.

## Instructions
Before going further, please make sure you have the Docker Engine and Docker Compose installed. To install the Docker Engine, visit Docker's [installation page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). To install Docker Compose, visit Docker's [compose installation page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Using the image with Docker Compose
This is an example of a docker-compose.yml file. You should change the values to suit your needs:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  fossbilling:
    image: fossbilling/fossbilling
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - fossbilling:/var/www/html
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: exampledb
      MYSQL_USER: exampleuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: examplepass
      MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD: '1'
    volumes:
      - mysql:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  fossbilling:
  mysql:
```

Then, use the web interface to install FOSSBilling. If you used this example, the database host field in the installer should be filled with mysql. Other fields should be self-explanatory.
