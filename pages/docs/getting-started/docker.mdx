# <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faDocker} /> Install Using Docker

## But wait... What is Docker?
Docker containers isolate the app from the host system and solve the "it works on my machine" headache. With this method, everyone using Docker runs virtually the same environment as the others. This is a great way to ensure that everyone has the same environment, thus making it less likely to have problems.

Docker also lets you run multiple containers on the same machine with different configurations. To learn more about containers, we strongly advise you to read Docker's [explanation](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) first.

## Prerequisites
Before going further, please make sure you have the Docker Engine installed. To install the Docker Engine, visit Docker's [installation page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and follow the instructions for your platform.

## Instructions
Our official Docker image can be used standalone or as part of a composition. The choice of which to use depends upon your needs and use-case.

As a general rule, if you are looking to run a simple FOSSBilling container that will connect to an external database, a standalone installation may be suitable. However, if you are looking for a ready-to-use environment, using Docker Compose may be more appropriate.

<Callout type='info'>
  These instructions use the `latest` image, which is the latest stable version of FOSSBilling. This can be changed to `preview` for preview versions, or to a specific version number, if required.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['Standalone', 'Docker Compose']}>

    This is an example of simply running the latest FOSSBilling image with a volume named `fossbilling` where changes will be persisted:

    ```
    docker run -d -p 80:80 -v=fossbilling:/var/www/html --restart=always fossbilling/fossbilling:latest
    ```

    Once the container has started, you can access the FOSSBilling web installer by visiting your server IP/hostname in a web browser. Using this method, you will require an external database and the details of this should be used in the installer.

    This is an example `docker-compose.yml` which uses our image along with the MySQL image (adjust to suit your requirements):

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    services:
      fossbilling:
        image: fossbilling/fossbilling:latest
        restart: always
        ports:
          - 80:80
        volumes:
          - fossbilling:/var/www/html
      mysql:
        image: mysql:8.2
        restart: always
        environment:
          MYSQL_DATABASE: fossbilling
          MYSQL_USER: fossbilling
          MYSQL_PASSWORD: fossbilling
          MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD: '1'
        volumes:
          - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    volumes:
      fossbilling:
      mysql:
    ```

    To use the above example `docker-compose.yml` run `docker compose up -d` while in the same directory to start the containers. The first startup may take a while as Docker will download the required images. Once the containers have been started, the FOSSBilling web interface can be used to complete the install. 

    If the example has been used on a local machine, the FOSSBilling web installer can be accessed at http://localhost, otherwise it can be accessed by visiting your server IP/hostname in a web browser. The database details, assuming they have not been changed, are:

    * Hostname: `mysql`
    * Database: `fossbilling`
    * Username: `fossbilling`
    * Password: `fossbilling`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Post-installation

<Callout type="warning">
  If the cron job is not configured, then FOSSBilling will not operate correctly.
</Callout>

Regardless of the installation method used, after completing the installation, you still need to configure a cron job to ensure scheduled tasks are run. This can be achieved using the command below on the host system (replacing `<container name/id>` with the container name/ID as appropriate):

```
(crontab -l; echo "*/5 * * * * docker exec <container name/id> su www-data -s /usr/local/bin/php /var/www/html/cron.php")|awk '!x[$0]++'|crontab -
```

If you do not know the container name or ID for the above, you can get a list of containers with `docker ps`.
