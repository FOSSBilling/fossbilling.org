# Building FOSSBilling

<Callout type='info'>
    Before beginning, ensure you have the following installed:
    - A version of PHP that's still under official support.
    - An up-to-date version of `composer`.
    - The current LTS version of `Node.JS` and `NPM`.
</Callout>

Building FOSSBilling from the source code is rather simple and only requires a few simple steps.

1. Clone the FOSSBilling repository and then move to that directory: `git clone https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling.git && cd FOSSBilling`
2. Install NPM dependencies: `npm -i`
3. Install composer dependencies: `composer install`
4. Build the front-end assets: `npm run build`
5. (_Optional_) Download the [latest translations](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/locale/releases/tag/latest) from the locale repository and extract the contents to the `src/locale` directory. Ensure you overwrite any existing files.
6. That's it, you're done! You now have a built installation of FOSSBilling under the `src` directory which can be uploaded to a web server.
