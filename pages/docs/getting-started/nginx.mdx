# <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faServer} /> Installing on an Nginx Server
nginx is a popular pretty popular web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. In this guide, we'll guide you through installing FOSSBilling on an nginx server.

<Callout type="info" emoji={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCircleInfo} />}>
  This guide will install the latest release. If you're planning to contribute to the development of FOSSBilling, it's strongly advised to build FOSSBilling from the main branch instead.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites
You will need to have the following installed. Please take a moment now to make sure you are ready:
* **nginx** ([Install guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-nginx)). Please skip the "Setting Up Server Blocks" part, we'll cover that in this guide)
* **PHP 8.0** or later ([Guide to install 8.1 on Ubuntu 22.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-php-8-1-and-set-up-a-local-development-environment-on-ubuntu-22-04))
* The following PHP extensions (the guide above also has a section that covers installing PHP extensions): `pdo_mysql`, `curl`, `zlib`, `openssl`
* **MariaDB 10.3** or later, or **MySQL 8** or later ([guide to install MariaDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-mariadb)) 

## Instructions

<Callout type="info" emoji={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCircleInfo} />}>
  If you need help writing your nginx config file, or just want to check what you have, you can use the [Configuration file generator](https://config.fossbilling.org/)
</Callout>

### Create a server block (virtual host) for your website
* Locate the following directory: `/etc/nginx/sites-available`
* Create an empty config file (i.e `fossbilling.conf`)
* Generate a configuration file for yourself using our new [configuration generator](https://config.fossbilling.org) or copy the example config from [GitHub](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/blob/main/data/nginx.conf)
* Edit the config to match your needs (Replace server name, add the PHP Fast CGI Pass, replace `fastcgi_pass php;` with `fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/phpx.x-fpm.sock;` or any of the examples shown below)
* fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/phpx.x-fpm.sock; , fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/phpx.x-fpm.sock;
* Change anything else you may need (SSL certificates, changing ports, etc)
* Change servername to your domain (i.e fossbilling.example.com)
* Run `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

### Installing FOSSBilling
* Download the latest [FOSSBilling release](https://fossbilling.org/downloads/stable) and then upload the files in the archive to the public directory of the site on your server, keeping the file structure as it is inside the archive.  
* Navigate to  to the install page on your domain (i.e fossbilling.example.com/install) 
* Ensure the following have public write access, `/var/www/.../src/config.php`, `/var/www/.../src/data/cache`, `/var/www/.../src/data/log`, `/var/www/.../src/data/uploads`
* Setup the database under the database tab
* Continue with Installation and setup
* Make `/var/www/.../src/config.php` read only
* Setup the admin username and password
* Click Finish and you are done!

## Common Problems

### FOSSBilling Displays Strangely / Mixed Content Warning
* Locate /var/www/.../src/config.php
* Locate `'url' => 'http://example.com/'` 
* Replace 'http' with 'https'
* Restart nginx ` sudo systemctl restart nginx `
