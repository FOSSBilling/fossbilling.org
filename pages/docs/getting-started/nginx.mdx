# <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faServer} /> Installing on an Nginx Server
nginx is a popular pretty popular web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. In this guide, we'll guide you through installing FOSSBilling on an nginx server.

<Callout type="info" emoji={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCircleInfo} />}>
  This guide will install the latest release. If you're planning to contribute to the development of FOSSBilling, it's strongly advised to build FOSSBilling from the main branch instead.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites
You will need to have the following installed. Please take a moment now to make sure you are ready:
* **nginx** ([Install guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-nginx)). Please skip the "Setting Up Server Blocks" part, we'll cover that in this guide)
* **PHP 8.0** or later ([Guide to install 8.1 on Ubuntu 22.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-php-8-1-and-set-up-a-local-development-environment-on-ubuntu-22-04))
* The following PHP extensions (the guide above also has a section that covers installing PHP extensions): `pdo_mysql`, `curl`, `zlib`, `openssl`
* **MariaDB 10.3** or later, or **MySQL 8** or later ([guide to install MariaDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-mariadb)) 

## Instructions

<Callout type="info" emoji={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCircleInfo} />}>
  If you need help writing your nginx config file, or just want to check what you have, you can use the [Configuration file generator](https://config.fossbilling.org/)
</Callout>

### Create a server block (virtual host) for your website
* Locate the following directory: `/etc/nginx/sites-available`
* Create an empty config file (i.e `fossbilling.conf`)
* Generate a configuration file for yourself using our new [configuration generator](https://config.fossbilling.org) or copy the example config from [GitHub](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/blob/main/data/nginx.conf)
* Edit the config to match your needs (Replace server name, add the PHP Fast CGI Pass, replace `fastcgi_pass php;` with `fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/phpx.x-fpm.sock;` or any of the examples shown below)
* fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/phpx.x-fpm.sock; , fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/phpx.x-fpm.sock;
* Change anything else you may need (SSL certificates, changing ports, etc)
* Change servername to your domain (i.e fossbilling.example.com)
* Run `sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/fossbilling.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`
* Run `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

### Setup Database


<Callout type="info" emoji={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTriangleExclamation} />}>
    Please note that 'RANDOM_STRONG_PASSWORD' should be replaced with an actual random and strong password.
    We want to clarify that it is not mandatory to use the username 'fossbillinguser' for the database. However, it is highly recommended to avoid using the root user, so instead please create and use a separate user with limited privileges for security reasons.
</Callout>

```bash filename="bash"
  mysql -u root -p
  CREATE DATABASE fossbilling;
  CREATE USER 'fossbillinguser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'RANDOM_STRONG_PASSWORD';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON fossbilling.* TO 'fossbillinguser'@'localhost';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Installing FOSSBilling
* Download the latest [FOSSBilling release](https://fossbilling.org/downloads/stable) and then upload the files in the archive to the public directory of the site on your server, keeping the file structure as it is inside the archive.  
* Navigate to  to the install page on your domain (i.e fossbilling.example.com/install) 
* Ensure the following have public write access, `/var/www/.../src/config.php`, `/var/www/.../src/data/cache`, `/var/www/.../src/data/log`, `/var/www/.../src/data/uploads`
* Run `chown -R www-data  644 /var/www/fossbilling.org/src/`
* Setup the database under the database tab with fossbillinguser
* Continue with Installation and setup
* Make `/var/www/.../src/config.php` read only
* Setup the admin username and password
* Click Finish and you are done!

## Common Problems

### FOSSBilling Displays Strangely / Mixed Content Warning
* Locate /var/www/.../src/config.php
* Locate `'url' => 'http://example.com/'` 
* Replace 'http' with 'https'
* Restart nginx ` sudo systemctl restart nginx ` 

### 502 Bad Gateway after installinmg
Make sure that you have installed phpx.x-fpm. If not:
* Run `sudo apt-get install phpx.x-fpm` (Replace x.x with your current PHP version `php -v`)
