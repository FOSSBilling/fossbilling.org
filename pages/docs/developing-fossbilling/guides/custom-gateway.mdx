    If you're looking to create your own extension, this documentation will tell you the bare minimum required, but looking at existing extensions will probably be necessary to get a complete idea on how to write one.

The "Custom" payment gateway in FOSSBilling is a generic payment gateway which can be used as a last resort.
The gateway itself provides no way to handle payments and only acts as a method to display instructions to your client so that you may manually process a transaction.

## Templates

When entering a custom template for the custom payment gateway, you should know that it's powered by twig and has the same twig [filters and functions](/docs/developing-fossbilling/twig-filters) as the rest of the software does.

Some [basic variables](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/blob/main/src/library/Payment/Adapter/Custom.php#L61-L65) are passed to twig, allowing you to display some additional information to the client.
To view the contents of the `invoice` variable, edit your `config.php` file to enable debug mode for twig and then place the following contents into your template:
```HTML
<pre>
    {{ dump(invoice) }}
</pre>
```

Be sure to disable debug mode for twig once you are done.
