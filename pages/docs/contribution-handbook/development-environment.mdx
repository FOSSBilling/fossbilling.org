Setting up a conducive development environment is essential for a smooth and efficient workflow. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your development environment for FOSSBilling.

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone the FOSSBilling repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling.git
```

Then, navigate into the FOSSBilling directory:

```bash
cd FOSSBilling/
```

Navigate into the src directory:

```bash
cd src/
```

Copy the sample configuration file to create a new one:

```bash
cp config-sample.php config.php
```

Go back to the main FOSSBilling directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

## Installing the Required PHP Packages

Install the necessary PHP packages using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php8.2-cli php8.2-common php8.2-gd php8.2-curl php8.2-dom  php8.2-zip php8.2-mbstring php8.2-cli php8.2-xml php8.2-tokenizer
```

You can confirm the PHP version with:

```bash
php -v
```

## Installing Composer

Install composer using these commands:

```bash
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'e21205b207c3ff031906575712edab6f13eb0b361f2085f1f1237b7126d785e826a450292b6cfd1d64d92e6563bbde02') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```bash

## Updating Dependencies

Next, update the project dependencies:

```bash
./composer.phar update
```

## Running Tests

Run the tests to ensure everything is set up properly:

```bash
src/vendor/phpstan/phpstan/phpstan
src/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit
```

Congratulations, your development environment is now set up and ready!
