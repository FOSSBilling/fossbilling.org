## Current Status
You can resell domains from within FOSSBilling, however the capabilities are rather limited.

### Limitations
 - Domain prices are static and configured on a TLD basis. FOSSBilling cannot and will not use pricing from your registrar at this stage.
 - Available TLDs are hard-coded inside of domain registrars.
 - Limited registrar support.

### Working Registrar Integrations
 - [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
 - [Netim](https://www.netim.com/)
    - Go check out the [registrar module they maintain for FOSSBilling](https://github.com/netim-com/fossbilling-registrar-module)

#### Generic Registrar Integrations
 - "Custom"
    - This one is entirely manual and should only be used as a very last resort.
    - Has the ability to use WHOIS to check for domain availability.
 - "Email"
    - Has the ability to use WHOIS to check for domain availability.
    - Allows you to configure a recipient who will be emailed whenever a domain is ordered. 
        - Currently, this email is sent using the PHP `sendmail` function rather than using the email options you've configured for FOSSBilling. We are aware of this issue and do intend to resolve it.
