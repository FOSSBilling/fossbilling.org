    This guide is incomplete. Please help us complete it using the **"Edit this page"** button in the sidebar. Thanks!
</Callout>

## Current Status

Implemented, but in a fairly simplistic way and without some creature comforts, such as:

 - No way to import existing accounts from a control panel.
 - When you suspend an order, the suspension reason is not sent to the control panel and is only used on the FOSSBilling end (Such as in an email to the client).
 - No support for SSO (logging clients into the control panel automatically).

### Working Control Panel Integrations

These are known-working control panel integrations that FOSSBilling has:
 - [CWP](https://control-webpanel.com/) (Control-WebPanel)
 - [HestiaCP](https://hestiacp.com/)
 - [Direct Admin](https://www.directadmin.com/)
 - [cPanel/WHM](https://cpanel.net/)
 - [Plesk](https://www.plesk.com/)

*Note:* Anything not listed here is likely to not work at all.
