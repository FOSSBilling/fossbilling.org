# Introduction

FOSSBilling (*FOSS*: Free and Open Source Software) is a billing and client management solution. We help digital businesses with an easy-to-use and free solution. 

What sets us apart from most competitors is our commitment to being fully open-source. You can audit exactly what's running on your server. Or better, contribute to the project yourself.

## We need more developers!
FOSSBilling is a community-driven project that thrives thanks to contributions from developers around the world.

Whether you're experienced with PHP, front-end technologies, UI/UX design, or you're just getting started in open source, there's a place for you here.

Our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling) is open to all. You can suggest features, report issues, or contribute code. From bug fixes and UI improvements to writing documentation and testing, every contribution counts.

Want to get involved? Join our [Discord](/discord) community and check out the [Developing FOSSBilling section](/docs/developing-fossbilling) to get started.

FOSSBilling also relies on donations to remain sustainable and independent. If coding isn't your thing but you'd still like to support the project, you can [donate on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/fossbilling) and help us keep moving forward.
