# Introduction

FOSSBilling (*FOSS*: Free and Open Source Software) is a billing and client management solution. We help digital businesses with an easy-to-use and free solution. What differentiates us from most of our competitors is being fully open-sourced. You can audit what's running on your server. Or better, contribute to the project.

## How FOSSBilling works
If you're a programmer, FOSSBilling is many different libraries, languages and technologies. The core is in PHP. We store data in a MySQL database. For the client area, we use Bootstrap, Font Awesome and other libraries to make it look and work great. The admin area uses [Tabler](https://tabler.io), a free and open-source admin area template. The source of FOSSBilling is available in the [FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling) repository on GitHub.

If you have experience in any of these technologies, we need new faces to help us out. Be brave, create your first pull request! We also have a small team of contributors who are always looking for new people to help out. Even if you don't know how to code, you can still give back to the community by providing feedback or just saying hi.

## Still need help?
In case we didn't cover your question here. We have a friendly community on [Discord](https://fossbilling.org/discord), where you can ask questions and get help from other developers and users.
