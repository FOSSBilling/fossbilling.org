# Customizing Invoice PDFs

## Invoice CSS

During the PDF generation, FOSSBilling first creates a simple HTML page and then converts that to a PDF using [dompdf](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf).

### Limitations

One important note to make, is that dompdf does not offer complete CSS support. Here is the limitations for dompdf as of version 2.0.3:

> - Handles most CSS 2.1 and a few CSS3 properties, including @import, @media & @page rules
> - Table cells are not pageable, meaning a table row must fit on a single page.
> - Elements are rendered on the active page when they are parsed.
> - Does not support CSS flexbox.
> - Does not support CSS Grid.

### Using custom CSS

By default, FOSSBilling uses the CSS from `/modules/Invoice/pdf_template/default-pdf.css`, however if you edit this file, any changes to it will be overridden when you update FOSSBilling.

Simply make a copy of the `default-pdf.css` file and place it under `/modules/Invoice/pdf_template/custom-pdf.css`. This new custom CSS file will be used instead of the original one, and it will not be overridden when you update FOSSBilling. You can now edit the `custom-pdf.css` file and use custom CSS for the PDF generation, keeping in mind the limitations described above.

### The layout

Please see the image below for information on the overall layout of the page and where CSS classes are used (color-coded):

## Invoice HTML

**This section is a WIP and will be improved over time**
Starting with FOSSBilling version 0.6.0, you can modify the template used to generate PDFs.

### Technology used

Just like the FOSSBilling front-end, PDFs are generated utilizing twig-based templates. This twig instance is configured the same as other options of FOSSBilling, meaning that the same filters are available.

### Using a custom HTML template

The default template FOSSBilling will utilize is `/modules/Invoice/pdf_template/default-pdf.twig`. If you want to use a custom one, create one under `/modules/Invoice/pdf_template/custom-pdf.twig` which will then be used instead of the default template.

### Twig Filters and Functions

Invoices gain access to the same filters that Twig does on the front-end with FOSSBilling.
You may find a list of these on the [Twig Filters & Functions](https://fossbilling.org/docs/contribution-handbook/twig-filters) page.
