  If you discover a security vulnerability in FOSSBilling, please **do not disclose it publicly**. Instead see our [security policy](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/security/policy) which will describe how to responsibly create a vulnerability disclosure. Not correctly following the disclosure policy may put FOSSBilling users at risk.
