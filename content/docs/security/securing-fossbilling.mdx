## FOSSBilling configuration

These following documents security options under the `config.php` configuration file.

### Security Options

#### Property descriptions 

| Config Property | Default Value | Allowed Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `strict` | `strict` or `regular` | Setting this to `strict` sets cookies to have their `samesite` attribute set to `strict` and they will be set as `httpOnly`. Setting it to `regular` will use the default cookie properties except that they will still be set as `httpOnly`. |
| `force_https` | `true` | `bool` | Setting this to `true` will cause FOSSBilling to redirect all requests to HTTPS and force cookies to only be sent over HTTPS.|
| `session_lifespan` | `7200` | `int` | This property configures the number of seconds that sessions are considered valid for. After this time period, they will expire and be destroyed. The default configuration is `7200` seconds (2 hours).|

#### Example in  the config
```
'security' => [
	'mode' => 'strict',
	'force_https' => true,
	'session_lifespan' => 7200,
],
```

### API options

#### Property Descriptions 

| Config Property | Default Value | Allowed Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CSRFPrevention` | `true` | `bool` | Enables or disables the usage of a CSRF protection system. This should be enabled at all times unless it is specifically causing issues.|

#### Example in  the config

```
'api' => [
	'CSRFPrevention' => true,
],
```

## Cloudflare
 - Enable `IP Geolocation` under your website's `Network` settings. This will allow FOSSBilling to use a visitor's country (based on IP address) to help prevent session hijacking.


## Reverse proxies

### Indicating HTTPS
 
Because of how reverse proxies typically work, it's common for the usage of it to make FOSSBilling think it's being accessed without HTTPS.
To fix this, simply ensure that your reverse proxy is forwarding the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header and that it's correctly set to `https`.
