# Twig Filters & Functions

FOSSBilling utilizes the popular twig templating engine for various purposes (front-end, email templates, PDFs, ect).
This documentation covers what twig filters FOSSBilling includes so that developers can better understand what's available to work with.

## From Twig

FOSSBilling includes all of the default twig filters plus the following additional filters through extensions:

- The [Intl Extra Extension](https://github.com/twigphp/intl-extra) & associated filters

## Custom

FOSSBilling has quite a few custom filters included in it. Here's the full list of them with further documentation coming in the future:

- `trans`: The translation filter.
- `alink`: Accepts a URI and turns it into a link for the administrator panel.
- `link`: Generates a full link for the FOSSBilling installation off of a URI.
- `autolink`: Automatically generates an HTML link element.
- `gravatar`: Accepts an email and optionally size and generates a gravatar image for it.
- `markdown`: Parses markdown into HTML, escaping HTML and removing unsafe links (`javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`, and most `data:` links`
  - Follows the CommonMark spec with GitHub markdown extensions enable via the `league/commonmark` package.
- `truncate`: Truncates a string down to a given maximum length.
